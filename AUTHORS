We've assimilated the help of various people and projects:

Michael W.    Lead coder
Pat K.        Major code suggestions and improvement, design help, sanity check
Ivy T.        Design help
Dana K.       Design help, being silly all the time
Lydia A.      Silliness, testing
Amanda H.     Design, UI, major logo help, making sure the interface
              doesn't look like crud.
Stephen D.    Suggestions and ideas
Neil F.       Saved me from having to trap keystrokes by hand by writing
              the diff-patch-match JS library

This project lovingly uses code from TinyMCE. Thanks, guys!
